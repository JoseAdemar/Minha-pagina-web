# Project (My Web Page)

## Project built with HTML/CSS and JavaScript

<p>This is a web project where I challenged myself to create a webpage without using frameworks like Bootstrap and other well-known tools in the market.</p>
<p>We know that using frameworks makes our work much easier and greatly boosts productivity. However, I wanted to enhance my skills with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for web development, forcing myself to have a deeper understanding and mastery of the technologies used to achieve the final result of my website.</p>

<p>To make the site responsive, I used CSS media query features and manipulated the menu buttons with plain JavaScript. Here's the link to view the webpage ðŸ‘‡</p>
